# Interactive Animations

Tech: Processing

About how to play the animation that I wanna show, there are a few easy tips for you.

### Easy Tips

Open those **.exe inside different folders (each contains a distinct animation), and there are various ways to play different programs.

- **Click the screen**

    1. The fractal tree will grow
    2. The sponge box will add its holes (The number of clicks is limited to 3 in case it is frozen)

- **Move around your cursor**

    1. The rotated card will follow your track
    2. The closer the cursor is to the center of the screen, the slower you will travel through the starry sky

- **Just watch**

    1. The flowing land will flow itself
    2. The lorenz curve will rotate and generate its color itself
